Supervised Clustering for Brain PET imaging studies
Developed by Julia J Schubert, Mattia Veronese and Federico E Turkheimer
Centre of Neuroimaging Sciences, IoPPN, King's College London

The package contains the set of MATLAB functions and scripts to 1) generate the tissue kinetic classes (for a given tracer X) and to 2) extract the reference region with the supervised clustering method (given the classes generated in 1)

It also contains several UTILITY functions (e.g. computeIDIF.m, dynPET_normalisation.m) that are ancillary to the main code.

Representative simulated data for testing the scripts can be made available upon request at https://molecularneuroimaging.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/svca_testingdata.zip
